The main notebook is named Stock Market Prediction using numerical and textual analysis. This analysis was done on the Yahoo Finance dataset. There is both numerical, and
textual analysis.

For some further analysis, and to test another algorithm ARIMA, the other notebook HUDCO_FEDBNK was uploaded. This analysis was done on a few months data on two specific stocks:
HUDCO BANK and FEDERAL BANK. These datasets are availabe on the NSE wesbite. But, it is to be noted that this analysis is solely on numerical data.
